# API-Hello-World i am jalil and this is my friend yasser ,the best team work ever ,at the moment we have the choice to make thing deferent 
So, actually, we are working on a project with the best teacher ever — the developer master Souhail. I hope to learn some new skills along the way.
We just started with the platform, beginning with GitHub and the basics of Git.
In the next step, we will move on to Docker to make things cleaner and more efficient.
After that, we'll use Ansible to automate everything.
Finally, we're looking into setting up a VPN.
It’s a nice story for a small project — maybe a small beginning, but full of potential.
